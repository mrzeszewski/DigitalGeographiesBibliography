## Introduction

This is list of academic books that provide a kind of introduction into the wide range of themes and topics that can be brought together under the term **Digital Geographies**. It started as a request on the [Digital Geographies Research Group mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DIGITALGEOGRGS) for a library purchase recommendation, but soon grow beyond that goal. It is provided here free of charge and without any warranty. Always incomplete but hopefully constantly inspiring to dive into the stimulating world of digital geographies.  

A version of this list is also available at the [Digital Geographies Research Group website](https://digitalgeographiesrg.org/) **(TO BE PUBLISHED)**

P.S. Why not include papers as well? A simple answer is that there are too many of them...but this is something to do as well. 

## Have something to add?

This is intended to be a collaborative endavour. This means that it is upon you to add books that are missing or new books that have just been published. 
You can help maintain this list through:
- [**Pull request**](https://github.com/mrzeszewski/DigitalGeographiesBooks/pulls) to add new things;
- [**Editing the file directly**](https://github.com/mrzeszewski/DigitalGeographiesBooks/edit/main/README.md) through forking;
- **Mail me at mrz@amu.edu.pl** or contact me in any other way with a suggestion.

Please try to keep formatting consistent with the list. Use APA style for citations. 
End a line with a double space for a line break.


## Digital Geographies Bibliography

Books are sorted into basic themes. They are are all arbitrary, as with all such classification, but they should give you some pointers as to where to start and where to dig deeper. Essentials are first on the list by obvious reasons but all the other themes are presented in no particular order. Publications are presented by date in all themes but the first one.
